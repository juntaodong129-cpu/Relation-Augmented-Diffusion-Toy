# Relation-Augmented Diffusion (Simplified)

## Overview
This project is a simplified implementation inspired by
"Relation-Augmented Diffusion for Layout-to-Image Generation".

The goal is to reproduce and understand the core idea of
explicit inter-object relation modeling in diffusion-based
layout-to-image generation, under limited computational resources.

## What is implemented
- Object bounding box conditioning
- Simplified relation box computation
- Relation-aware conditioning in a diffusion pipeline
- Toy-scale experiments for qualitative evaluation

## Motivation
The project focuses on understanding *why* relation modeling
improves spatial and semantic consistency, rather than achieving
state-of-the-art performance.
